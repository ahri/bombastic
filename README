Bomber will be:
        Dedicated to involving Jenn in stuff I enjoy; coding and gaming
        A bomberman clone
        Multi platform
        Event based
        Multiplayer
        Flexible as far as clients go
        A way for me to learn more python
        
Status:
        Working RESTful server
        Two example clients

Plan:
        Game Engine
            make sure blanket removals (of a class) don't happen; remove each object individually
            flame vt/hz/combo subtypes (x-over can be determined by flaming another flame)

                ascii vs. unicode...

            Some way to reset the game
            Winning condition (which also resets the game)

        Server
            Manhole ability on localhost http://www.devshed.com/c/a/Python/SSH-with-Twisted/3/
            Spawn voting (to remove need for admin)
            Generate docs when calling without children (instead of just returning "This is a bomberman server")

        Client 0 (python) [COMPLETE]
            Provides an admin and a player interface
            Mostly available as a demo client
            Allows for easy testing and example formulation of the server API

        Client 1 (python) [COMPLETE]
            Console; termios-based, naive and doesn't throttle requests

        Client 2 (jquery) [COMPLETE]
            Grab input
            Output game state to <pre>

        Client 3 (jquery)
            As client 2, but replace chars with table of images via dict lookup
            flame vt/hz/combo recognition

        Client 4 (python)
            AI player

        Client 5 (python/c)
            Console interface for POSIX (curses)

        Client 6
            GUI interface (Linux/Windows/Mac)
