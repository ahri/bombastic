            Winning condition

        Server
            Generate docs when calling without children (instead of just returning "This is a bomberman server")

            Provides an admin and a player interface
            Mostly available as a demo client
            Allows for easy testing and example formulation of the server API

            Console; termios-based, naive and doesn't throttle requests

        Client 2 (jquery)
            Grab input
            Output game state to table

        Client 3 (jquery)
            As client 2, but replace chars with images via dict lookup

        Client 4 (python)
            AI player
