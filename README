Bomber will be:
        dedicated to Jenn
        a bomberman clone
        multi platform
        event based
        multiplayer (local, network later)
        flexible as far as clients go
        a way for me to learn more python
        
Status:
        Turn based game engine working to Alpha level

Plan:
        GUI interface (still turn-based)
        Move to time-based, smoother GUI, bombs tick down over 3 seconds
        Networking
